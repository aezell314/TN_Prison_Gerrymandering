##Processing
CVAP data for Tennessee was retrieved with a Python script from the Census. 
The data is available nationally for the State Legislative Districts - Upper (SLDU). 
To extract the data for Tennessee the national data was grouped by state and then extracted to a new file for each state. 
The data was pivoted from narrow to wide data based on GEOIDs so that one row is one State Legislative Districts - Upper (SLDU), and each field represents either an estimate or margin of error for a particular racial/ethnic category. 
The fields were renamed to fit character length requirements. 
The shapefile was zipped into a folder with supporting files, ACS documentation, and this README. 
Processing was primarily completed using the pandas library.
To improve the usefulness of the data, we have add three categories to correspond with the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) racial categories. The "Alone or In Combinations" categories for American Indian or Alaska Native (fields with "AIA"), Asian (fields with "ASN"), and Black or African American (fields with "BLK") represent an encompassing racial category that is inclusive of all categories that include that race. For example, CVAP_AIA22 would be the sum of the "Alone" CVAP_AMI22, CVAP_AIB22, and CVAP_AIW22. For CVAP_BLK22, the field would be the sum of the "Alone" CVAP_BLA22, CVAP_AIB22, and CVAP_BLW22. For CVAP_ASN22, the field would be the sum of the "Alone" CVAP_ASI22 and CVAP_ASW22. These fields are also noted in the description as being "Alone or In Combination". No other estimate categories were modified.
For the estimates that were modified to fit OMB racial/ethnic categories, we also modified the Margins of Error as well. To create the new MOEs for the derived estimates, we summed the squared values of each MOE for the necessary fields, and then took the square root of the summed value. The fields that are represented with these modified MOEs correspond to the modified racial categories described above. They are rounded to the nearest hundredth.
For more information on OMB racial categories, please see this link: https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/omb/bulletins_b00-02/#n_1_
All of the racial estimates provided are Non-Hispanic. Breakdowns for Hispanic/Non-Hispanic by race are not provided in the CVAP special tabulation.
Null values or empty cells in the CSV file retrieved from the Census are assigned the value -999999.
The tabular data for Tennessee was joined with geospatial data from Census TIGER files on the unique identifier field (GEOID20) and extracted as a shapefile. 
Processing for the join used pandas and geopandas libraries.
